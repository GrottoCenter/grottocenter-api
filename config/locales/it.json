  "This site, although it may contain detailed information on caves, was not designed to facilitate the visit for none caver people Dangers are not necessarily reported and information mentioned is not everytime verified Caving is a discipline with many facets: cultural, science and sports In the latter capacity, it often requires a physical commitment It is also not free of risks, and even major risks These risks, if they can not be completely eliminated, are at least greatly reduced by a practice in the rules, practice which is fully understood when under a caving club (grotto) In any case GROTTOCENTER and its team can not be held liable for a bad practice of caving The novice who would engage in underground exploration is urged to contact a caving club The names and contact information can be obtained among other to the IUS (International Union of Speleology), to GROTTOCENTER or to his national federation": "\n\n\n",
